Module 11 assignment

1. 

i) Insertion anamoly
 If we want to add new ProvNo details, it can't be added because, it requires a patient visit to include these details. 'Prov' details can't be added until there is a patient visited them.
 
 ii) Update anamoly
 
 If patient city need to be changed i.e consider PatNo 1 whose city is DENVER and to be changed to 'STANLEY', it requires multiple rows in database to be updated due to redundancy and may lead to partial updates in worst cases.
 
 iii) Delete anamoly
 
 If we delete 'VisitNo v82110' tuple, it will delete the data related to 'ProvNo D3' and may result in incomplete database.
 
 2.
 
 PatNo->PatAge  	 All the tuples in table satisfy the functional dependency.
 PatZip->PatCity 	 All the tuples in table satisfy the functional dependency.
 VisitNo->VisitDate 	 All the tuples in table satisfy the functional dependency.
 PatNo->PatZip          All the tuples in table satisfy the functional dependency.
 ProvNo->ProvSpeciality All the tuples in table satisfy the functional dependency.
 VisitNo->PatNo         All the tuples in table satisfy the functional dependency.
 VisitNo,ProvNo->Diagnosis All the tuples in table satisfy the functional dependency.
 ProvNo->ProvEmail      All the tuples in table satisfy the functional dependency.
 ProvEmail->ProvNo      All the tuples in table satisfy the functional dependency.    
 
 Tables:
 
 Table 1: 
 Diagnosis(VisitNo,ProvNo,Diagnosis,
 (VisitNo,ProvNo) PRIMARY KEY
 ProvNo FOREIGN KEY REFERENCES Prov
 PatNo FOREIGN KEY REFERENCES Patient
 VisitNo FOREIGN KEY REFERENCES Visit)
 
 Table 2:
 Prov(ProvNo PRIMARY KEY,ProvSpeciality, ProvEmail)
 
 Table 3:
 Patient(PatNo PRIMARY KEY,PatAge,PatCity,PatZip)
 
 Table 4:
 Visit(VisitNo,VisitDate,PatNo
 PatNo FOREIGN KEY REFERENCES Patient
 )
 
 3.	Student (StdNo, StdName, StdEmail, StdAddress, StdCity, StdState, StdZip )
	Lender(LenderNo, LenderName)
	Institution(InstNo, InstName, InstMascot)

There is a trivial dependency among StdNo,StdEmail and StdName
Student city can determine the zipcode and state of student and therefore the table can be splitted as below:

BCNF TABLES:

Student (StdNo, StdName, StdAddress, StdCity)
StudentMail(StdNo,StdEmail)
City (city,zip,state)
Lender(LenderNo, LenderName)
Institution(InstNo, InstName, InstMascot)

4. Functional Dependencies with column 'OrdNo' as determinant

OrdNo -> ItemNo       Tuples 1 and 2 falsify this FD
OrdNo -> QuantityOrd  Tuples 3 and 4 falsify this FD
OrdNo -> CustNo       All tuples satisfy this FD
OrdNo -> CustBal      All tuples satisfy this FD
OrdNo -> CustDisc     All tuples satisfy this FD	      
OrdNo -> ItemPrice    Tuples 1 and 2 falsify this FD
OrdNo -> OrdDate      All tuples satisfy this FD
